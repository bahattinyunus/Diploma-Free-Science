# Contributing to Diploma-Free-Science 🤝

We are building the world's most comprehensive open university. We need your expertise!

## How You Can Contribute

### 1. Curate Curricula 📚
-   **Add Missing Topics:** Is our "Quantum Mechanics" roadmap missing a crucial resource? Add it.
-   **Verify Links:** Ensure all linked courses, books, and papers are still valid and free.
-   **Create New Paths:** Design a learning path for a niche field (e.g., *Mycology*, *FPGA Programming*).

### 2. Tool & Resource Hunting 🛠️
-   Found an open-source alternative to MATLAB? A free database of chemical structures?
-   Add them to `resources/tools.md`.

### 3. Code Contributions 💻
-   Improve our pathway generator scripts (`src/`).
-   Build new tools for tracking study progress or visualizing data.
